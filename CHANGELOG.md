# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Static verification — M14: `!Par` enters `--verify`
- Functions whose only effect is `Par` are now verifiable (other effects
  still skip honestly).
- **Fork–join determinism:** for a pure verifiable worker `f`,
  `join(go(f, x)) ≡ f(x)` — the worker spec applies via M5 assume–guarantee
  (requires discharged at spawn, ensures assumed for the join result).
- **Handle protocols:** ghost state per symbolic handle —
  `spawn → join | detach`; join/detach after consume is REFUTED with a
  counterexample (join-after-detach is fatal at runtime). Channels track
  open/closed; `send` on a known-closed channel is provably `-1`.
- New JSON field `"protocol"` for kind-3 obligations.
- Boundary (honest skips): pair-returning builtins (`chan_recv2`,
  `chan_try_recv`, `chan_select2*`), mutexes, `pool_map`, effectful workers.
- Examples: `examples/verify/par_{join,join_bad,detach_bad,chan}.baga`.
- Note: `docs/thesis-m14-par-fragment.md`.

### Proof extraction
- `--proofs` now prints the verifier's established facts, not just heuristics:
  - `_terminates` uses the real verdict — recursion with a proven `decreases`
    measure is reported as full correctness; otherwise honestly partial.
  - while-loop invariants appear as `lemma <fn>_invariant_<k>` with their
    Hoare status (init + preservation proven, or honestly unproven → UNKNOWN).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-02

First tagged release after the static-verification arc and theory write-up.

### Static verification (`--verify`)
- **M0–M7** — linear i64 paths, while invariants, bounds, element axioms,
  assume–guarantee recursion, `decreases` termination, integer tightening
- **M8–M12** — product symbols, sign table, const/var div–mod, floor mul,
  complete square, AM-GM identity, conclusiveness gate (no false alarms)
- **M13** — products inside `if`/`while` guards; sound bitwise envelope
  (`| & ^` neutrals, `n&1∈{0,1}`, `<<`/`>>` special cases)

### Concurrency & backends
- `!Par`: `go` / `join` / channels / select wait–timeout
- LLVM `!Par` parity via `libbaga_par.so`

### Docs
- `docs/theory-{en,bg}.md` — Fourier–Motzkin, Farkas, ℤ-tightening, M0–M13
- `docs/thesis-m13-nonlinear-fragment.md` — research note

### CLI
- `baga --version` / `-V` prints `baga 0.2.0`
